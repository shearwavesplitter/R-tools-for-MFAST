# R-tools-for-MFAST
## Most of these functions have been depreciated and (their functionality) moved to shearwavesplitter/MFASTR. fn_projmap.R is the exception.
Tools written in R for analysis of MFAST summary files. See manual.pdf for a description of these functions and their usage.
There is no guarantee that these functions are bug free or perform calculations correctly.
FOR INSTALLATION: Paths are set up for a folder labelled "R_MFAST" in your home directory ( i.e. "~/R_MFAST") to contain these files. Required packages also need to be installed (see first.R for a list)
